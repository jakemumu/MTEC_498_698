# Week 1

Hey everyone —

Apologies to be sending your assignment via email, there appears to be some slowness with getting me into the new Canva or whatever the current LMS system is.

Your assignment for this week is to get your IDE working and become familiar with the C++ language syntax, and especially the concepts we went over in class:

If you remember:

----

// Understanding Types
// Understanding how to make types, AKA classes
// Understanding Inheritance
// Understanding Memory (Pointers)

----

If you can understand and experiment with these concepts inside of C++, then you are well on your way to making awesome software.

The step by step assignments:

Step 1 - Get your IDE working and create a new command line application using the C++ language. (If you’re not sure how to do this in your IDE, google is your friend) — when we have the LMS setup I would ideally put a video snippet from the class lecture which showed this step. Please email Zane & Myself if you’re having trouble.

Step 2 - Be able to compile and see the “hello world” output

Step 3 - Experiment with the concepts above — I recommend following along with these video:

// Classes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABRP_5RYhqU
// Inheritance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq2Igdc-OSI
// Pointers / Memory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa6S8Pz924k

These videos are short and sweet, but C++ beginner materials in abundance, if you prefer to learn from another place feel free to do so, I know code academy also has an amazing online / interactive C++ beginner series:

Your homework submission will be a short little main.cpp file which is where you experimented with these concepts, as well as an impromptu multiple choice test when I’m able to get one setup.

Also — I’ve setup a GitHub for the course here where I’ll post materials accompanying each week:

https://github.com/jakemumu/MTEC_498_698

And the main.cpp from class: https://github.com/jakemumu/MTEC_498_698/blob/main/Week%201/Week%201%20Command%20Line/main.cpp

Good luck! Please reach out if you need assistance.

Best,

Jake
